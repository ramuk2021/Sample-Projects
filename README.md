This repo supports following array sort algorithms -
- Bubble Sort : Bubble Sort compares each element of the array with every other element. Time complexity of bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2)
- QuickSort : More efficient when compared to Bubble Sort. Chooses a pivot element from the array, partitions the array based on the pivot and recurse. It has a average or best case complexity of O(nlog(n)) and worst case complexity of O(n^2)
